Q1:Convert Binary Number in a Linked List to Integer
Given head which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of each node in the linked list is either 0 or 1. The linked list holds the binary representation of a number. Return the decimal value of the number in the linked list.
Sol1: 
answer = 0
        while head: 
            answer = 2*answer + head.val 
            head = head.next 
        return answer
        
Sol2:
val = []
        while head:
            val.append(head.val)
            head = head.next
        return int(''.join(map(str,val)),2)
