Uploaded graph for various time complexity
Uploaded best and worst time complexity of all algorithms and data structures
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QovOdd80A4s  -  DSA time complexity
Big Oh notation- Upper bound(Jada se jada itana time) Mostly used
Theta - avg case complexity(Lag bhag)
Omega- lower bound(kam se kam)
Time limit exceeded (TLE error)- 10^8 operation rule is used. Most of the modern machine can perform 10^8 operations/second.
MAX value of N                       Time complexity
<=[10....11]                         O(n!), O(n^6)

   10^6                              O(N) Perfect
   10^7                              O(N) Might be accepted
   10^8                              O(N) Border case
   10^9                              O(logN) or Sqrt(N)
  *Tip1- Build logic first on paper the write code
  *Tip2- Don't spend more than 30 min in a problem. if stuck on a question for 10-15min check discussion forum(hints). then try solving if not the check answer.
  *Tip3- If solved question while seeing answer bookmark that question & come back after 1 week.
  *Tip4- For every problem try to see  in which topic what types of patterns are being used to solve which types of problems.
  *Try Open source development
  Read gate algo notes.
