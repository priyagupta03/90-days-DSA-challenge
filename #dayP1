Question: Given two non-negative integers low and high. Return the count of odd numbers between low and high (inclusive).
Solution1:
class Solution:
    def countOdds(self, low: int, high: int) -> int:
        diff = high-low
        if(low%2==1 or high%2==1):
            return 1+ int(diff/2)
        return int(diff/2)
        
Solution2:
class Solution(object):
    def countOdds(self, low, high):
        return (high-low-high%2-low%2)/2 + high%2 + low%2
        
        
        
        
Question: You are given an array of unique integers salary where salary[i] is the salary of the ith employee.
